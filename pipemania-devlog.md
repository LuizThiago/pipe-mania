- Analyzed possible stacks and decided on **Vite + TypeScript + PixiJS + ESLint + Prettier**;
- Created the GitHub repository and set up the initial project with linting and formatting;
- Made the first **tile art sketch** (empty pipe, curve and cross) and defined the base visual style;
- I thought about how to approach the flow of water (dynamic mask using Pixi Graphics sounds the best approach).
